Running AirStream on Raspberry Pi (Beginner Guide)

This guide explains how to run AirStream – Offline In-Flight Entertainment System on a Raspberry Pi.
It is written for first-time users, so no prior Raspberry Pi or Linux experience is required.

What You Need (Hardware)

Raspberry Pi (Raspberry Pi 3, 4, or 5 recommended)

microSD Card (16 GB or more)

microSD Card reader (USB)

Power adapter for Raspberry Pi

Laptop / PC

One or more mobile phones for testing

Optional: USB keyboard and HDMI monitor
(You can also use SSH later)

Step 1: Install Raspberry Pi OS

On your laptop, download Raspberry Pi Imager
https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/

Insert the microSD card into your laptop.

Open Raspberry Pi Imager and select:

Device: Raspberry Pi (your model)

OS: Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit recommended)

Storage: Your microSD card

Click Write and wait for completion.

Safely eject the microSD card.

Step 2: First Boot of Raspberry Pi

Insert the microSD card into Raspberry Pi.

Connect:

HDMI cable to monitor

Keyboard

Power ON the Raspberry Pi.

Complete the initial setup:

Language

Time zone

Username and password

Wi-Fi (optional for setup)

Once done, you will see the Raspberry Pi desktop.

Step 3: Update Raspberry Pi

Open Terminal on Raspberry Pi and run:

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y


This ensures your system is up to date.

Step 4: Install Required Software
Install Python (usually preinstalled)

Check Python version:

python3 --version


If not installed:

sudo apt install python3 -y

Step 5: Copy AirStream Project to Raspberry Pi
Option A: Using Git (Recommended)

Open Terminal on Raspberry Pi.

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Tusharjain-19/air-stream.git


Go into the project folder:

cd air-stream

Option B: Manual Copy (Beginner Friendly)

Download ZIP from GitHub on your laptop.

Extract the ZIP.

Copy the folder to a USB drive.

Plug USB into Raspberry Pi.

Copy folder to Desktop or Home directory.

Step 6: Add Media Content (Local Only)

For legal and privacy reasons, the GitHub repository does not include movies or music.

You must add your own test files locally.

Example:

air-stream/
└── assets/
    ├── videos/
    │   └── list all movies
    ├── audio/
    │   └── song.mp3


Use small test files for smooth playback.

Step 7: Start the AirStream Server

From inside the project folder, run:

python3 -m http.server 8000


You should see:

Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000


Do not close this terminal.

Step 8: Connect Devices to Raspberry Pi
Option A: Use Raspberry Pi as Wi-Fi Hotspot (Advanced)

For production or advanced setup:

Configure Raspberry Pi as a Wi-Fi Access Point

Use hostapd and dnsmasq

(This is optional and can be added later.)

Option B: Simple Testing (Recommended for First Time)

Connect Raspberry Pi to any Wi-Fi network.

Find Raspberry Pi IP address:

hostname -I


Example output:

192.168.1.120

Step 9: Access AirStream on Phone

Connect phone to the same Wi-Fi network.

Open browser.

Enter:

http://<RaspberryPi_IP>:8000


Example:

http://192.168.1.120:8000


The AirStream homepage will load.

Step 10: Offline In-Flight Simulation (Optional)

To simulate real inflight behavior:

Turn Airplane Mode ON on phone

Keep Wi-Fi ON

Reload the page

If content loads, AirStream is working offline correctly.

Common Problems & Fixes
Website does not open

Ensure server is running

Check IP address again

Confirm phone and Raspberry Pi are on same network

Videos not playing

Ensure files are in correct assets/videos/ folder

Use .mp4 format

Avoid very large files during testing

Why Raspberry Pi is Used

Low power consumption

Small size (aircraft-friendly)

Works completely offline

Cost-effective

Ideal for MVP and scalable deployment
