AirStream – Offline In-Flight Entertainment System

AirStream is an offline-first In-Flight Entertainment (IFE) system that allows passengers to access entertainment content through onboard Wi-Fi without requiring internet connectivity. The system delivers a web-based entertainment portal accessible from personal devices such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops.

This project focuses on understanding how inflight entertainment systems work in constrained, offline environments and explores a low-cost, scalable alternative to traditional seat-back IFE systems.

Project Overview

AirStream operates by hosting a local web application and media services on an onboard server. Passengers connect to the aircraft’s Wi-Fi network and access the entertainment portal through a browser, similar to a captive-portal flow used by airlines.

The current implementation is tested using a laptop as the onboard server to simulate real inflight conditions. Future versions will migrate to a Raspberry Pi–based setup to evolve the project into a deployable MVP and scalable product.
